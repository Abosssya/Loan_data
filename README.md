### Project Introduction
Loans are an essential part of the banking industry, and understanding factors such as the loan amount, borrower's income, and loan term that affect loan approval and repayment is essential for making effective decisions. Using Excel, SQL, and Tableau, I examined patterns in loan amounts, demographic data, and credit behavior to offer recommendations that can improve lending strategies and customer orientation.
